                <h2>Health App Features</h2>

                A new feature added to the LCC Health App emulator is the medicine notification. This feature notifies the user at five-second intervals that it is time to take their medication. <br><br>

                Next time, we plan to improve this feature by allowing it to read an external JSON file and output medication via a dynamic array. This will allow the user to know which medication to take as well as its dosage and practice where the prescription is issued. Hence it will be able to better imitate a real-life situation where users may have multiple medications to take at different time intervals.

                <h2>Social Dynamics & Challenges</h2>

                Assignment 3 revealed the true nature of our team dynamic. Unlike during the previous two assignments, this time our lack of communication has greatly affected our ability to effectively work in a cohesive environment and this is clearly shown in our final product. <br><br>

                Our health app can be divided into three large areas: heart rate monitor, GPS locator and medicine notification. Initially, each area was delegated to an individual member. This meant that the said member would be responsible for the emulator, prototype proper and most of the test files for that part of the project. We saw this as a means to giving members the freedom to explore creative options as well as a solution to our inability to regularly meet up as a group. <br><br>

                When creating the draft system, this above approach failed to follow the schedule. Due to unforeseen circumstances such as family issues, the roles and jobs were re-prioritised in order to meet the deadline. As a result, we decided to use pair programming this time around. Two members were assigned to each area, and each pair followed the schedule outlined for each area. We felt like this would still allow for independent work as well as helping us to better keep to the schedule, improve communication and assist each other with any technical challenges. In the end, this approach proved to be successful amongst some of the members of the team. <br><br>

                Consequently, we can conclude that our members are able to work well independently as well as in pairs, to meet a deadline. However in terms of a team dynamic, we lack cohesiveness due to a lack of communication between members and the absence of a project manager within the team. We seem more like individuals working on separate parts of the emulator, rather than a group of members working towards a common goal. As a result, progress on parts of the features could be completed successfully but our project lacks cohesion as a whole. Hence in the future, we will need to assign a clear leader that everyone reports to so at least one person is aware of the progress of the individual parts of the assignment.

                <h2>Human Issues</h2>

                One of the many challenges faced was the absence of members. Regular group meetings were scheduled for every Monday and Friday in order for members to program together and allow for discussion of solutions to any problems that may occur. However, only during the first and last meeting were all members present. Members were absent due to commitments to other courses, illnesses and part-time work. There were also many unexplained absences where a member did not show up nor notify beforehand. Therefore in order to compensate for the absences, the schedule was shuffled so that members present at the meeting could work on parts of the emulator that did not require the immediate contribution of the missing members. Furthermore, progress was committed to the GitHub repository and communication through social media was used. In the future, we will approach this problem by being stricter with follow-ups for unexplained absences and making alternative meeting arrangements. For example, we could change the location of the meetings to accommodate members that find it inconvenient to always meet at the Owheo labs.<br><br>

                This leads to the biggest challenge faced throughout this assignment. For our group, there was a complete breakdown of communication. First, there was a miscommunication between members. One member wanted to independently work on one area of the project while the under two members were still under the impression that every part was going to be completed via pair programming. As a result, this member worked independently and only occasionally updated the other two members on the progress through social media. Furthermore, they no files were updated on GitHub throughout this entire period (until after the last meeting), so the other two members could only rely on occasional social media updates. When combined with unexplained absences from meetings, there was essentially no communication between the two parties. However, the other two members also contributed to this inefficient communication. They relied on committing code and messages to GitHub as a means of communicating with the other party. Regular updates via text messaging and social media were not used so the member that was independently working was also kept in the dark about the rest of the project. Hence a lot of trust in our teammates was required throughout this assignment. Consequently, this lack of communication is highlighted by the lack of cohesion and finesse in our finished system.<br><br>

                We approached this problem by regularly asking the other party to upload their work onto GitHub and offering help via text messaging and social media such as facebook messenger. However, most of the attempts were ignored. Therefore, the members could only focus on other parts of the emulator and prototype proper while trusting in the abilities and skills on the member that was working independently. In the end, this trust turned out to be well placed, as we were able to combine everything successfully.  If such a situation were to occur in the future, we will first attempt to contact absent members in person. Furthermore, we will improve communication by keeping a ‘log of progress’ document. Members can submit entries for each session spent on the assignment, even if no coding progress is made. This will increase awareness of progress of the whole project. It will be more effective than just relying on word-of-mouth and GitHub updates because we encountered many sessions that were solely dedicated to research rather than programming. Furthermore, if the problem persists, we will also approach our lecturer with our concerns and listen to their suggestions.


                <h2>Programming Experience</h2>

                Assignment 3 has been an extremely challenging but educational programming experience. The absence of a strong programmer in this team meant that progress was very slow as a lot of time was spent finding solutions through trial and error. Furthermore, we are aware that our emulator has a lot of room for improvement due to our limited skills. However this gave each member an equal chance to improve their programming skills and consequently, we were able to better develop our skills in HTML, Javascript and JSON. This also means that in the future, we will be able to build upon these newly acquired skills, such as becoming better at using jQuery.<br><br>

                One of the tools used in this assignment is pair programming. We felt that by pooling our resources, we could compensate for our limited programming skills. Pair programming turned out to be extremely effective as we were able to combine our strengths and knowledge to help each other out. It also facilitated communication between members and allowed us to discuss ideas with each other. <br><br>

                Other tools used included online tutorials, such as the JSON tutorials, and also NetBeans. We found NetBeans to be very useful for this assignment. It allowed us to test our emulator on multiple web browsers as well as providing an in-built debugging tool. Another debugging tool we found useful was firebug. <br><br>

                The main process we followed during this assignment was agile. Agile allows for changes to be made after the initial planning which was extremely suitable for us as we did not have a clear picture of the final product in mind. This incremental approach is flexible and adaptable to change which enabled us to add or remove features in order to meet the deadline. Furthermore, by working in modules, we were able to test sprints as we went along as well as receive input from other members and reflect upon our project priorities at the each of each sprint.<br><br>

                However, we also fully experienced the disadvantages to using agile. The absence of a successful project manager resulted in our inability to meet the deadline with a refined emulator and prototype proper. Since we essentially ran out of time, we also had to remove features from our project, resulting in a final product that differs substantially from the initial plan.<br><br>

                We realize that our project has a lot of room for improvement and refinement. This is a direct reflection of our limited programming skills, inefficient teamwork and resource management. Consequently, this has been a great experience for all the members as we can clearly identify the areas that require both individual growth as well as improvement as a team.
