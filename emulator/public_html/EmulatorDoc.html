        <h2>Emulator Installation</h2>
        <p>You can download our emulator from github: <a href="https://github.com/cosc345/emulator">Download</a></p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>1. To navigate and run the emulator, click the emulator file.<br>
            2. Click on public_html file.<br>
            3. Then click setup.html
        </p>
        <h3>Running the emulator</h3>
        <p>To be able to run the emulator, just click the setup.html file<br>
            But first you need to install a server using python and here's how
        </p>
        <h3>Server Installation</h3>
        <p>1. If you don't have python installed. Download the latest version of python<br>
            2. Under command line environment, navigate to the file that has the setup.html in it.<br>
            3. Type in this command -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080.</p>

        <h2>Running the Application</h2>
        <h3>For users</h3>
        <p>For the most part it is difficult to install a new app without prior experience with HTML and javascript.<br>
            But for the pre-installed apps, you can select any app from the selection tray and click load<br>
            To clear app, click clear
        </p>
        <h3>For Developers</h3>
        <p>For running the pre-installed apps, the instruction is much the same as the users instruction.<br>
            For new apps, follow this instruction closely.<br><br>
            1. The app must be in Javascript.<br>
            2. You can put the app file anywhere you like. But it must be within the public.html file.<br>
            3. Use the path for the application to run the app.<br>
            4. Add your application path finder with the selection tray of the setup.html.<br>
            5. The value attribute of the app's selection must be your source path. For example HealthApp/health.js.


        </p>
        <h3>To Run the application</h3>
        <p>The canvas name is 'emulatorCanvas'.<br>
            Use the runningScript(file) method under emulatorForm.js to run the app.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Bugs</h2>
        <p> When click clear, the application does not clear properly sometimes</p>
